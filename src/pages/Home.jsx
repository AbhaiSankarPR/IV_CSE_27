        <p>
          The Industrial Visit (IV) 2025 marks a memorable journey for the CSE students of SCT College of Engineering.
          It’s more than a trip — it’s a blend of learning, travel, and teamwork, connecting classroom concepts with
          real-world innovation. From exploring industries in <strong>Ahmedabad</strong> to the golden sands of
          <strong> Jaisalmer</strong>, the royal charm of <strong>Jaipur</strong>, the calm hills of
          <strong> Shimla</strong>, and the vibrant energy of <strong>Delhi</strong>, this IV stands as a milestone for
          the 2023–27 batch — a celebration of friendship, curiosity, and the spirit of engineering.
